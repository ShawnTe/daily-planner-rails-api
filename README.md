2. Token-based authentication  
3. RSpec testing

2. Clean up Todos (doing anything here??)  
3. Plan day  
  - Set Brainjuice session lengths  
  - Assign Todos to Container by Brainjuice  
    - receive error if too many  
    - unassign as needed  
4. Get to work!  
  - View only Todos in current Brainjuice session  
  - Edit Todos if nec  
  - Mark Todos complete  
5. End of session wrap up  
  - Decide if undone todos carry over or return to Pool of Possibilities
